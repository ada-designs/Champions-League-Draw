Champions League Group Stage Draw Simulator

This project takes inspiration from real-world tournament draws and brings it to life with randomization, interactive features, and a clean, responsive design.

Here’s what I added to make it more engaging:
▶ Dynamic Group Generation: Teams are randomly assigned to groups with unique constraints for a realistic simulation.
▶ Interactive UI: The app allows users to generate new draws seamlessly with a single click.
▶ Mobile Responsiveness: Ensures the app looks great and works perfectly across all devices.
▶ Custom Team Logos: Visuals include team-specific icons for better user experience.

Some key skills I honed during this project:
▶ Leveraging JavaScript to handle arrays and dynamic data updates.
▶ Using DOM Manipulation to render real-time changes in the UI.
▶ Building a responsive design that adapts smoothly to different screen sizes.
▶ Managing modular and reusable code to support new features in the future.
